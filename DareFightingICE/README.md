Welcome to the <b>DareFightingICE Competition</b>. This competition is our way of including the mostly ignored group of players when it comes to video games. You are invited to develop an AI and/or design a sound design for Java-based DareFightingICE, FightingICE with an enhanced sound design. FightingICE itself had been successfully used in a fighting game AI competition launched in 2013 and from 2014 to 2021 as an official competition at IEEE CIG/CoG. From <a href="https://ieee-cog.org/2022/" target="_blank">CoG 2022</a>, there are two tracks. The first track is an AI competition, and the second track is a sound-design competition. You are invited to submit an AI capable of operating with only sound input information or/and a sound design for visually impaired players.
