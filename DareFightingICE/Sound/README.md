<div align = "center"> Welcome to the sound design track of DareFightingICE. Here you will be provided all the necessary information needed to participate in the sound design track. Please remember to read carefully and thoroughly before contacting us for any questions you might have. </div>
<br>


### What is Sound Design Track:
----
As you can already tell from the name, you have to design a sound design for the DareFightingICE. Keep in mind that DareFightingICE is targeting visually impaired people, so the sound design you come up with should be made for visually impaired people. You will be provided with a sample sound design and all the sound effects used in the sample. 


### What To Submit:
---
You are provided with a version of DareFightingICE that already has a sample sound design in it. You will be allowed to edit a part of the source code in the game as well as add your own sounds. Doing this gives you the full ability to design your own sound design. You will submit the sounds, the files you are allowed to edit, and a slideshow explaining the changes and the reasoning behind them. Keep in mind that you are not required to edit the source code, you can just change the sounds, but give them the same name as the sounds already in the sound folder. To change the background music just overwrite the “BGM0” audio file with your own background music (name should remain the same). <br>
Files you are allowed to edit are:
-	DareFightingICE\src\fighting\Character.java
-	DareFightingICE\src\manager\SoundManager.java <br>
Directory for sound effects:
-	DareFightingICE\data\sounds <br>
~~~
For this competition, you will only need to come up with the sound effects for a single character (Zen).
All the sound effects must be in .wav format. The sound effects should be mono or stereo unless you have changed the source code. 
~~~

### Sample Sound Design:
---
The sample sound design is made using openal from the Lightweight Java Game Library (lwjgl). There is a total of 51 sound effects in the sounds folder including the background music. For the sample sound design, some sound effects are the same for similar moves. To know in detail what the moves look like visit this [link](https://www.ice.ci.ritsumei.ac.jp/~ftgaic/ZEN_action_animations.htm).<br>
There are a few special sound effects added into the DareFightingICE.
-	<b>Heartbeat:</b> This sound effect is played when the player’s health is below 50. For player 1 the sound effect is played on the left speaker and for player 2 on the right.
-	<b>Energy Increase:</b> This sound effect is played when the player’s energy goes +50 from the previous value. For player 1 the sound effect is played on the left speaker and for player 2 on the right.
-	<b>Border Alert:</b> This sound is played when a player reaches the end of the stage on either side. And the sound played on the left side when players reach the end of the stage on the left side and the same for the right side.
<br>
These three special sounds are in place to help visually impaired players be aware of their and their opponent’s health and energy status. Also, it will help make them aware of their surroundings.


### Rules
---
- The sounds you submit must be copyright-free.
- One team can only submit one sound design.
- If you add any new sound (Special sound effect) which is not in the sample sound design. You are asked to give a reason for the addition.
- If any sound effect is found not to be copyright free you will be contacted to change and resubmit before the deadline. If you are not able to resubmit before the deadline, your submission would be discarded. 

### Evaluation:
---
Evaluation of your sound designs will be done as follows: <br>
Normal people (people with vision) will test your sound design while wearing a blindfold. The total number of people testing your sound design is not static, but rest assured it will not be a very small number, like 3,4, etc. The blindfolded people will play against a weak AI (a weak form of MCTS AI), the reason for the AI being weak is that these people are not visually impaired and are not used to playing a game blindfolded. Each person will play against the AI 3 times (3 matches) for a sound design and the score will be calculated by how many people were able to defeat the AI and how much health they have left. If they were not able to defeat the AI, the remaining health of the AI will be counted. After the play, they will be asked to complete a sound aesthetic survey. The results of this survey will also be counted in the final score of your sound design. Apart from the blindfolded people. Our sample blind AI will play the game against MCTS AI, also 3 times. The AI learning rate, win-lose ratio, and hp difference will be used in the total score. In the end, the sound design with the highest overall score will win. <br>
If you are the winner of the sound design track, we will ask you for your permission to use your sound design as the sound design in the AI track of our competition.
